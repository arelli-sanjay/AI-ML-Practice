#  AI & ML Practice

###  Introduction

This repository showcases my **hands-on practice work** in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Each notebook covers a key ML concept — from data preprocessing to advanced algorithms — and includes both **theoretical explanations** and **practical implementations** in Python.
The goal of this repository is to document my learning progress while building a strong foundation in ML for future AI-based research and projects.

###  Tools & Libraries

All implementations are done in **Python**, using the following libraries:

* **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling and numerical operations
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Core machine learning algorithms and preprocessing tools
